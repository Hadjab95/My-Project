# SALAMA ONLINE STORE
# Overview 

This project is a website for my own online store. I started a small business a year ago selling muslim women dresses, shoes and handbags so I decided to build a website where I will able to  display and sell my products online. This website will allow users to effortlessly browse through a diverse range of offerings, add desired items to their carts, and securely complete transactions. I decided to name my store "Salama" which comes from my mother's name "Salamata" and which means "Peace". The finished website will incorporate essential features such as intuitive product search, efficient categorization, user account management, secure payment processing, and order tracking.
